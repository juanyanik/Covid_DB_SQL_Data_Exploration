# Covid_DB_SQL_Data_Exploration

This project involves analyzing data related to COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide up to 2021. The data is stored in two database tables named CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations, which contains information about the number of cases,deaths and vaccinations in various locations and dates.

The project uses SQL queries to extract and manipulate the data in various ways. Some of the queries include:

Sorting the data by the number of cases and deaths.
Calculating the percentage of deaths among infected people in a specific location.
Calculating the percentage of the population that got infected with COVID-19 in a specific location.
Ranking the countries by the highest infection count.
Showing the countries with the highest death count per population.
Showing the percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine.
Calculating the global numbers of new cases and deaths and the death percentage.
Using a Common Table Expression (CTE) and a Temp Table to perform calculations on the data.
Creating a View to store data for later visualizations.
Overall, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL queries. The results can be used to better understand the impact of the pandemic on various locations and populations and inform public health policies and interventions.
